# Laplacian Renormalization Group
Here we study the coarse-graining process of heterogeneous networks. This is the code for our paper [Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-022-01866-8).

## Directory structure
- `Degree-distribution`: Contains the Python code for generate a coarse-grained version of the network, showing the final degree distribution of the downscaled network. Please cite [1] and [2] if you use this code.
